# Backend Service

This is the backend service for our application, built using NX and Node.js.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies are used in this monorepo:

- **React**
- **NestJS**
- **TypeORM**

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (v14 or later recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **MySQL**: Ensure you have a running MySQL instance. You can download it from [mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/) and set it up locally or use a remote instance.
3. **Redis**: Make sure Redis is installed and running on your machine or available via a remote connection. Check out [redis.io](https://redis.io/download) for installation instructions.
4. **Email Credentials**: Set up email credentials for your application to handle outgoing email services.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=dev

# Database
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=itplus
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Mail
